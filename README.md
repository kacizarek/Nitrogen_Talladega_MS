**Repository Purpose**

This repository contains analyses and data supporting Zarek et al., a study investigating the spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen dynamics in a forested headwater stream over the course of an annual drying event. This study, specifically, used a combination of high-frequency water quality sensor data at the watershed outlet, spatially intensive synoptic sampling campaigns for in-situ net denitrification conditions and other physicochemical parameters, and finally, a denitrification potenital rate experiment
throughout the watershed. 

**Repo Description**

The _01_tidydata_ folder contains the high-frequency sensor data (e.g., discharge, nitrate, temperature, and more; ds01), physicochemical parameters (e.g., nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, etc.; ds02), N2 excess data, and a file with the full record of study ASDN and discharge (Q) data (ds03). 
The _02_Rscripts_ folder contains the analyses done and code for figures made. The _03_plots_ folder contains the final plots used in the manuscript.
